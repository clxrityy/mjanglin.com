- Utilizes [`discord-api-types`](https://discord-api-types.dev/) to facilitate requests and responses to/from the [interactions endpoint](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#receiving-an-interaction)
- Custom types are implemented to achieve additional functionality and usability within the application
