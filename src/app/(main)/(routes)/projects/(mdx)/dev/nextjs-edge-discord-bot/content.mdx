# How to host a Discord bot on Vercel with Edge Functions

<MainImage />


## Edge Features

- **Fast**: Edge Functions are executed at the edge of the network, close to users, which means they run with lower latency.
- **Secure**: Edge Functions are sandboxed and run in a secure environment.
- **Scalable**: Edge Functions scale automatically with traffic, so you don't have to worry about provisioning or managing servers.
- **Simple**: Edge Functions are easy to deploy and manage, with a simple API and CLI.

## Overview

This page is a comprehensive guide on how to host a Discord bot on Vercel with Edge Functions. I'll cover everything from setting up a new Discord bot to deploying it to Vercel.

### Throughout this guide, here are the tools that will be utilized:
- **Database & Storage**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) & [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-projectgres)
    - Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes it easy to work with databases. Vercel Postgres is a managed PostgreSQL database that is easy to set up and use.
    - The extension [Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/accelerate) is also utilized for edge caching.
- **Discord API**: [discord-api-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-api-types) is a package that provides TypeScript types for the Discord API.
- **OAuth2**: Multiple packages are used to facilitate authentication through Discord with encryption and security in mind.
    - **[cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie)**: A package that provides cookie parsing and serialization.
    - **[jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)**: A package that provides JSON Web Token (JWT) support.
    - **[crypto-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js)**: A package that provides cryptographic functions.
    - **[tweetnacl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweetnacl)**: A package that eases process of verification with Discord.

## Template repositories

All of this wouldn't be possible without the work from [@jzxhuang](https://github.com/jzxhuang) and his [nextjs-discord-bot](https://github.com/jzxhuang/nextjs-discord-bot) template:

<TemplateRepository />

> This template provides you with the basic starter boiler plate for registering commands, and handling interactions with Discord on Edge runtime.

---

To extend that template further for the purpose of authentication and an interactive dashboard, I created a fork of it:

<DemoRespository />

> #### This template extends the base template to include:
> - OAuth2 authentication with Discord
>   - Including encyption, cookie management, and JWT verification
> - Prisma for database management (storing authenticated users)
> - A simple dashboard to view authenticated users

For an extended overview on the changes made to the initial template and how to set it up, check out the [pull request](https://github.com/jzxhuang/nextjs-discord-bot/pull/4) I made to the original repository.

## Getting Started

- Create a new Discord bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Clone the [demo repository](https://github.com/clxrityy/nextjs-discord-bot-with-oauth).
    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/clxrityy/nextjs-discord-bot-with-oauth.git
    ```
- Add your environment variables to a `.env`/`.env.local` file:
    ```env
    # Settings -> General Information
    DISCORD_APP_ID=
    DISCORD_APP_PUBLIC_KEY=

    # Settings -> OAuth2
    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=

    # Settings -> Bot
    # Required to register commands and fetch the list of commands in the web app
    # Technically not required to actually run the bot
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
    ```
- Install the dependencies:
    ```zsh
    pnpm install
    ```
- Run the development server:
    ```zsh
    pnpm dev
    ```
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Commands

### Defining & Registering

Commands are defined as an `ApplicationCommand` type.

##### Application command type: ([reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands))

```ts
export type ApplicationCommandOption = {
    type: number;
    name: string;
    // ...
}

export type ApplicationCommand = {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    options?: ApplicationCommandOption[];
    permissions?: number[];
}
```

#### Command definition example:

```ts
import { ApplicationCommand } from "@/types/interactions";

const PING_COMMAND: ApplicationCommand = {
    name: "ping",
    description: "Replies with Pong!"
} as const;

export default PING_COMMAND;
```

Every command is exported in the primary `index.ts` file:

```ts
/**
 * @see https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#registering-a-command
 */
import PING_COMMAND from "./misc/ping";

export const commands = {
    ping: PING_COMMAND,
}
```

- To register commands, run the `pnpm register-commands` script.

```ts
import { commands } from "@/data/commands";
import { env } from "./env.mjs";
 /**
 * @see https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#bulk-overwrite-global-application-commands
 */
async function main() {
    const reponse = await fetch(`http://discord.com/api/v10/applications/${env.CLIENT_ID}/commands`, 
    {
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Authorization": `Bot ${env.BOT_TOKEN}`
        },
        method: "PUT",
        body: JSON.stringify(Object.values(commands))
    });
}
```

### Interaction API

- All interactions are sent to the [interactions endpoint](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#receiving-an-interaction) (`/api/interactions`).
    - Reference: [Discord Developer Docs | Interactions Endpoint URL](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/overview#configuring-an-interactions-endpoint-url)
- The interaction request is verified with the package **[`tweetnacl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweetnacl)**
    - Verifies the interaction request is from Discord and intended for our bot.
    - Reference: [Discord Developer Docs |  Receiving and Responding to Interactions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#security-and-authorization)
    - See the **<ins>verify</ins>** code [here](https://github.com/clxrityy/mjanglin.com/blob/hbd/src/utils/verify.ts)

Within the interactions endpoint, data from the interaction is parsed into an `InteractionData` interface:

```ts
export interface InteractionData {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    options?: InteractionSubcommand<InteractionOption>[] | InteractionOption[] | InteractionSubcommandGroup<InteractionSubcommand<InteractionOption>>[];
}
```
> This includes the value(s) of the option(s) and subcommands.

### Interaction Response

- This is where the **edge** runtime comes into play.

```ts
// api/interactions/route.ts

/**
 * @see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes
*/
export const runtime = "edge";
```

- The interaction is received and verified:

```ts
export async function POST(req: Reqest) {
    /**
    * @see https://github.com/clxrityy/mjanglin.com/blob/hbd/src/utils/verify.ts
    */
    const verifyResult = await verifyInteractionRequest(req, env.PUBLIC_KEY);

    const { interaction } = verifyResult;
}
```

> The interaction is parsed into the `InteractionData` interface mentioned before

- A response is sent back to Discord based on the command name in the form of an [interaction response object](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#create-interaction-response)
    - [type](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type)
    - [data](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-data-structure)

```ts
import { InteractionSubcommand, InteractionOption } from "@/types/interactions";
// ...

switch (name) {
    case commands.ping.name:
        return {
            type: InteractionResponseType.ChannelMessageWithSource,
            data: {
                content: "Pong!"
            }
        }
}
```

## Prisma

Prisma is a modern database toolkit that makes it easy to work with databases. It provides a type-safe and auto-generated query builder that's tailored to your database schema.

- Data is stored with [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-projectgres).
- Additionally, [Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate) is utilized for edge caching.

```zsh
pnpm add @prisma/client @prisma/extension-accelerate
```

```zsh
pnpm add -D prisma
```

- To initialize the Prisma client run `npx prisma generate`.
    - Now you can use the Prisma client to interact with your database.

```ts
// src/lib/db.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate";

function makePrisma() {
    return new PrismaClient({
        datasources: {
            db: {
                url: process.env.ACCELERATE_URL
            }
        }
    }).$extends(withAccelerate());
}
```

- See [Nextjs Prisma Postgres](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-projectgres) for more information on setting up Prisma with Vercel Postgres.

### Schemas & Models

- Prisma schemas are defined in the `prisma/` directory.
- The first necessary schema is the **`User`** model:
    - Easing the process of storing user data through OAuth2 authentication.

```prisma
model User {
    id           String     @id @default(uuid())
    userId       String     @unique
    accessToken  String     @unique
    refreshToken String     @unique
    // More added later
}
```

- After defining the schema, run `npx prisma db push` to create the table in your database, and `npx prisma generate` to generate the Prisma client.
    - Now you can interact with the `User` model in your application.

```ts
import { db } from "@/lib/db";

export async function getUser(userId: string) {
    return await db.user.findFirst({
        where: {
            userId: userId
        }
    });
}
```
