<SleepgraphHeader />

This is a website that allows you visualize your sleep patterns.

- You start by logging in / signing up with [Clerk]("https://clerk.com/")
    - Register with your email
    - Confirm your email
<SleepgraphAuthExampleImage />

- You now have access to the dashboard
    - Which has 3 different routes to choose from
        - Adding a sleep record
        - Viewing your sleep records
        - Viewing your sleep pattern graphs
    - The dashboard is media responsive and has a mobile menu

<SleepgraphDashboardImage />

- This is all due to the use of a server layout:
    - Which is a layout that is shared across all pages
    - It is used to check if the user is authenticated
    - If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the login page
- The user data is fetched from the server and passed down to the dashboard layout

```tsx
return (
    <DasbbarLayout userData={userData}>
        <div className="w-full flex flex-row">
            <MobileDashbar userData={userData} />
            <div className="flex w-full my-20 px-16">
                {children}
            </div>
        </div>
        <Toaster />
    </DashbarLayout>
);
```

- The sleep records are stored in a postgres database
    - The user can add a sleep record by filling out a form
    - The user can view their sleep records in a table
        - And delete records if needed
    - The user can view their sleep pattern graphs
