## Introduction

- As a music producer, I am always looking for sounds and samples to use in my music. I also inevitably end up with a lot of audio files that I don't always use, or even remember that I have.
- I wanted to create a simple way to display and listen to these audio files, and also to be able to download them easily.
- There are other websites and sources that do this as well, such as [looperman](https://www.looperman.com/), [splice](https://splice.com/), and [freesound](https://freesound.org/), but I wanted to create my own version that I could customize and control (and be accustomed to my own style).
    - Also, it's worth mentioning that none of these websites have an interactive audio player that allows you to actually visualize the waveform of the audio file, which is something I wanted to incoorporate.
- The website ([clxrity.xyz](https://clxrity.xyz), based on my artist name) is still **very much** in the works. This is merely a prototype of what I want to achieve.

## Building an audio waveform visualizer package

<ReactAudioRepo />

> **Note:** This package is very much still in the works.

- At the core of this project is an audio waveform visualizer package that I am building. This package will allow you to visualize the waveform of an audio file, and also interact with it (e.g. play, pause, seek, etc.).

```zsh
npm i @clxrity/react-audio
```

### Web Audio API

- To start off by interacting with audio files in the browser, it was essential to utilize the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
    - For the use of interfaces such as [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext), [MediaElementAudioSourceNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaElementAudioSourceNode), [AnalyserNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode), etc.

### Canvas

- To visualize the waveform of the audio file, I utilized the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). 
    - For the use of interfaces such as [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D), [CanvasGradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasGradient), etc.

- I created a [`<Canvas />`](https://github.com/clxrityy/react-audio/blob/main/src/components/ui/Canvas/index.tsx) component that takes in the following props:

```tsx
import { ComponentPropsWithRef } from 'react';

interface CanvasProps extends ComponentPropsWithRef<'canvas'> {
    analyzerdData: AnalyzerData;
    color: string
    size?: {
        width: number
        height: number
    }
}
```

- A reference to the canvas element is created using the `useRef` hook.

```tsx
import { ElementRef } from 'react';

const canvasRef = useRef<ElementRef<'canvas'>>(null);
```

- I created a `draw()` function that is called within a [`useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) hook that will be called whenever data changes.
    - I also created an `animateBars()` utility function that will fill the canvas with the waveform data.

```tsx
const draw = (
    analyzerNode: AnalyserNode,
    bufferLengthCount: number,
    dataArrayDigits: Uint8Array,
) => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    if (!canvas || !analyzerNode) return;

    const canvasCtx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    const animate = () => {
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        canvas.width = canvas.width;
        animateBars({
            analyzer: analyzerNode,
            canvas,
            canvasCtx,
            dataArray: dataArrayDigits,
            bufferLength: bufferLengthCount,
            color,
        })
    }

    animate();
}
```
