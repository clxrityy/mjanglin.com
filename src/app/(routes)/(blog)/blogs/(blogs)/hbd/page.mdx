A dynamic Discord bot built for customizing birthday events within a guild.

> Built with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

I wanted to create a Discord bot that's behavior could be configurable for each guild's specifications. I began by creating a template with the structure of the bot.

The template includes a **command** handler, **event** handler, and a configuration file. The command handler is responsible for handling commands, the event handler is responsible for handling events, and the configuration file is responsible for storing the bot's *default* configuration.

```

│   ├── commands/
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── events/
│   │   ├── ...
├── ├── handlers/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   ├── config.ts
│   ├── index.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...
```

The client is initialized within `index.ts`:
