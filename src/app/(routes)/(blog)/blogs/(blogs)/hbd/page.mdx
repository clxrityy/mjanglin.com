I wanted to create a Discord bot that's behavior could be configurable for each guild's specifications. I began by creating a template with the structure of the bot.

The template includes a **command** handler, **event** handler, and a configuration file. The command handler is responsible for handling commands, the event handler is responsible for handling events, and the configuration file is responsible for storing the bot's *default* configuration.

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── commands/
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── events/
│   │   ├── ...
├── ├── handlers/
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   ├── config.ts
│   ├── index.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...
```

- The **handler** (`handlers/index.ts`) is responsible for handling events emitted by the Discord bot, such as commands being executed or the bot being ready.

- All events are registered within `events/` and all commands are registered within `commands/`.
    - **ex.**
    ```
    ...
    ├── events/
    │   ├── ready/
    │   │   ├── registerCommands.ts
    │   │   ├── ...
    ...
   ```
   > Whenever the **`ready`** event is emitted, the `registerCommands.ts` file is executed (along with any other files within the directory).

For more information about the template for the general structure of the bot template, setting up typescript, and adding configurability, you can read my blog here: [How to Create a Dynamic AI Discord Bot With Typescript](https://dev.to/clxrityy/how-to-create-a-dynamic-ai-discord-bot-with-typescript-3gjn).

### Installation / Set up

- Clone the repository (or use the [template](https://github.com/clxrityy/ai-discord-bot))

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clxrityy/ai-discord-bot.git
```

- Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    - `BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
        > [Discord Developer Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
    - `MONGO_URI` - Your MongoDB URI
        > [MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)

    > **Note:** You can also add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` & `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION_ID` if you want to use the OpenAI API to utilize AI capabilities.

- Start the bot to make sure it works properly
    - `pnpm dev`

### Birthdays

The first feature I wanted to implement was the ability for users to store their birthday within the bot. I created a command that allows users to set their birthday, which is stored within a MongoDB database.

I started by creating a `Birthday` schema within the `models/` directory:

```typescript
import { model, Schema } from 'mongoose';

const BirthdaySchema = new Schema({
    GuildId: { type: String, required: true },
    UserId: { type: String, required: true },
    Birthday: { type: Date, required: true }
});

export default model('Birthday', BirthdaySchema);
```

I added a folder within the commands directory (`birthday/`) which will be responsible for handling all birthday-related commands.

The first command is `/birthday`:

> **Note**: Paramaters within `<>` are required, and parameters within `[]` are optional.

- `/birthday set <date>` - Sets the user's birthday
- `/birthday view [target]` - Views the user's birthday or the target's birthday
- `/birthday list [month]` - Lists all guild birthdays or birthdays within a specific month

Important factors I considered to implement with this:

- **Validation** - Ensuring that the user's input is valid (valid date, valid month, etc.)
- **Error Handling** - Handling errors that may occur during the process (and returning those errors to the user)
- Making sure that users cannot set their birthday more than once

### Interval

Now that the birthdays are stored within the database, I wanted to create a feature that would allow the bot to send a message to announce when it's a user's birthday.

I needed the bot to check if it's a user's birthday every day at a specific time. So, I created an `interval` event that would check if it's a user's birthday every 24 hours.

```ts
import { Client } from "discord.js";
import Birthday from "../../models/Birthday";

module.exports = (client: Client) => {

    const handleInterval = async (client: Client) => {
        let filter = {}
        const birthdays = await Birthday.find(filter);
        let date = new Date();

        const dateString = date.toLocaleDateString();
        const dateArray = dateString.split("/");
        const dateParsed = dateArray[0] + `/` + dateArray[1];

        for (const birthday of birthdays) {

            if (birthday.Birthday === dateParsed) {
                client.emit("birthday", 
                [birthday.UserID, birthday.GuildID]);
            }
        }
    }

    return setInterval(async () => await handleInterval(client), 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
    // 1000ms * 60s * 60m * 24h
}
```

- This emits the `birthday` event whenever it's a user's birthday, after checking once every day.

The problem with this was the date. I'm emitting this event once the bot is ready only once, and the date is not updated. I need to update the date every day.

At first, I was overthinking how I could update the date every day. I tried to create a separate event that would check the time... But then I realized I could create a utility function that would return the current date and pass it to the `handleInterval()` function.

```ts
module.exports = (client: Client) => {
    const handleInterval = async (client: Client, date: Date) => {
        /**
         * Check if it's a user's birthday
        */
    }
    return setInterval(async () => 
    await handleInterval(client, getDate()), 
    1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
}
```

### Guild configuration

Since the bot is now checking if it's a user's birthday (and emitting the `birthday` event), all I needed to do was implement functionality for the event.

On birthdays, I needed 2 things to happen:

- The bot sends a message to the guild wishing the user a happy birthday
- The bot gives a special role to the birthday user
    - This role will be removed after 24 hours

While sending a birthday message was simple, I couldn't hard code a role ID to be given to each user (given the unique nature of each guild) and I didn't want the bot to manually create the role. It would be best if guilds could be configured to specify the role they want to give to birthday users.

I created a model for guild configurations that would store:

```ts
import { model, Schema } from "mongoose";

const guildSchema = new Schema({
    // Guild ID
    GuildID: String,
    // Channel to send birthday announcements
    AnnouncementChannel: String,
    // Channels where commands can be executed
    CommandsChannel: [String],
    // Role that can configure the bot
    AdminRole: String,
    // Role to give to birthday users
    BirthdayRole: String,
    // Whether users can change their birthday
    Changeable: Boolean,
    // Message to send on birthdays
    AnnouncementMessage: String, 
});

export default model("Guild", guildSchema);
```

Next was to create a command(s) that would allow admins to configure the bot for their guild.

##### **`/config`**
- `/config view` - Views the guild's configurations
- `/config channels <announcement | commands> <channel>` - Sets the announcement or commands channel
- `/config roles <admin | birthday> <role>` - Sets the admin or birthday role
> - `/config <channels | roles> reset` - Resets the channels or roles
- `/config changeable <true | false>` - Sets whether users can change their birthday
    - If **true**, users can change their birthday
    - If **false**, only admins can change birthdays
        - `/edit` - Edits the user's birthday
- `/config messages <announcement> <message>` - Sets the message to send on birthdays
    - The message can include `{{user}}` to mention the user
